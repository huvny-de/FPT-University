Create | The file is created with no data. The purpose of the call is to announce that the file is coming and set some of the attributes.

Open | Before using a file, a process must open it. The purpose of the open call is to allow the system to fetch the attributes and list of disk addresses into main memory for rapid access an subsequent call.

Close |When all accesses are finish the attributes and disk addresses are no longer needed, so the file should be close to free up internal table space

Read | Data are read from file

Write | Data are written to the file again usually at the current position

Append | This call is a restricted form of write it can only add data to the end of the file.

Seek | Seek is that which reposition the pointer to the current position to a specific Place in the file

Set Attributes | Some of the attributes are user settable and can be change after the file has been created.
